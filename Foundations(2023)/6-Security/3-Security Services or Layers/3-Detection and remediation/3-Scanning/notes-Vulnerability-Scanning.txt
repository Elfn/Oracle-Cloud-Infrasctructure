* Scanning
    * Definition
        * It routinely checks hosts for potential vulnerabilities
        * You also hear this term called CVE, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. And there's a database which it's a CVE-- you can think of CVE as a known database of vulnerabilities
        * So the job of the service is to go against our database and check regularly and report on vulnerabilities and exposures
        * Now, the way the service works, even though it's not shown on the screen here, is you create these things, which are called scanning recipes. And scanning recipes determine what information to examine and how often to examine. The two options available today are daily or weekly.
        * So basically, you write this recipe. You say how often to examine for these CVEs, either you specify daily or weekly. And then, there are a couple of other important parameters you specify. 
    * Parameters
        * Port scanning
            * The port scanning. So that, when you specify that option, the service checks for the 1,000 common ports and sees if any of the ports that are unintentionally left open and those kind of things. It checks for those ports.
        * Agent-based scanning
            * the service checks against the standard benchmarks published by the Center for Internet Security, also referred to as CIS
            * It assigns a risk level. If the report meets 20% of the benchmarks, it assigns a score. It's 40%, it assigns a score, 80%, it assigns a score, and so on and so forth. And you should read that up on the documentation.
